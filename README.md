Начало задания.

 

There are two text files A and B, each containing a sorted sequence of integer numbers.

Write a program which produces text file C containing sorted sequence of all numbers from files A and B.

File A contains n numbers, file B contains m numbers, and the resulting file C must therefore contain n + m numbers.

Each number in files A, B, and C is stored on a separate line.

 

Memory consumption of the program must be O(1). Running time must be O(n + m).

 

Optional task: write unit tests for your code (use a unit testing framework like JUnit or TestNG).

Optional task: write documentation for your code in JavaDoc format, in English language.

Optional task: make a standalone Maven project with your code and upload it to a public repository (e.g. on GitGub or Bitbucket).

 

Example:

 

Given file A:

0

1

4

Given file B:
